## Usage

There are many ways/formats of how to use outlined-icons. The fastest and recommended way is via SVG directly. Or use the webfont version if you want to include all icons at once:

### SVG icons -- when you need just a few icons in your project

1 . If you want to use just a few icons. Find the icons you need in "icons" folder. Then use them as regular images:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="@icon/outlined-icons/icons/boat.svg" />
```

2 . Icons can be served from a CDN such as [Unpkg][Unpkg]. Simply use the `@icon/outlined-icons` npm package in the URL like the following:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/@icon/outlined-icons/icons/boat.svg" />
```

### Icons font -- ideal when you want to include all icons at once

1 . Install `@icon/outlined-icons` with this command. In the `<head>` of your html, reference the location to your `outlined-icons.css`.

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@icon/outlined-icons/outlined-icons.css">
...
</head>
```

2 . Use [unpkg.com][Unpkg] to load directly outlined-icons without installing anything:

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@icon/outlined-icons/outlined-icons.css">
...
</head>
```

> Place outlined-icons with `<i>` tag in your html like this. Icon class names are to be used with the `oui` class prefix.

```
<i class="oui oui-boat"></i>
```
