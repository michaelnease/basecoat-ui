### SVG icons -- when you need just a few icons in your project

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="@icon/simple-icons/icons/500px.svg" />
```

2 . Icons can be served from a CDN such as [Unpkg][Unpkg]. Simply use the `@icon/simple-icons` npm package in the URL like the following:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/@icon/simple-icons/icons/500px.svg" />
```

```
<head>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="@icon/simple-icons/simple-icons.css">
...
</head>
```
