### SVG icons -- when you need just a few icons in your project

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="@icon/hawcons-stroke/icons/bookmark.svg" />
```

 2 . Icons can be served from a CDN such as [Unpkg][Unpkg]. Simply use the `@icon/hawcons-stroke` npm package in the URL like the following:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/@icon/hawcons-stroke/icons/bookmark.svg" />
```

### Icons font -- ideal when you want to include all icons at once

 1 . Install `@icon/hawcons-stroke` with this command. In the `<head>` of your html, reference the location to your `hawcons-stroke.css`.

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@icon/hawcons-stroke/hawcons-stroke.css">
...
</head>
```

 2 . Use [unpkg.com][Unpkg] to load directly hawcons-stroke without installing anything:

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@icon/hawcons-stroke/hawcons-stroke.css">
...
