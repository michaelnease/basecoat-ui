## Usage

There are many ways/formats of how to use feather. The fastest and recommended way is via SVG directly. Or use the webfont version if you want to include all icons at once:

### SVG icons -- when you need just a few icons in your project

1 . If you want to use just a few icons. Find the icons you need in "icons" folder. Then use them as regular images:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="@icon/feather/icons/book.svg" />
```

2 . Icons can be served from a CDN such as [Unpkg][Unpkg]. Simply use the `@icon/feather` npm package in the URL like the following:

```
<img height="32" width="32" src="https://unpkg.com/@icon/feather/icons/book.svg" />
```

### Icons font -- ideal when you want to include all icons at once

1 . Install `@icon/feather` with this command. In the `<head>` of your html, reference the location to your `feather.css`.

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@icon/feather/feather.css">
...
</head>
```

2 . Use [unpkg.com][Unpkg] to load directly feather without installing anything:

```
<head>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@icon/feather/feather.css">
...
</head>
```

> Place feather with `<i>` tag in your html like this. Icon class names are to be used with the `fe` class prefix.

```
<i class="fe fe-book"></i>
```
